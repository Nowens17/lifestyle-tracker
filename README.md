# lifestyle-tracker
This is a simple web application designed to allow a user the ability to log and review weight/date data sets, as well as corresponding food intake for a specific day. The application includes a basic login/logout/signup functionality. Users logging in will be directed to a dashboard/homepage that shows a calendar of their logged weights.
